# Web Development Assessment 

**Task: <br>Create a single-page personal website from scratch with HTML and CSS and host it on GitHub.**

The content for the personal website does not have to be yours - Feel free to use another person, a celebrity, a business, a pet (or anything fun, really) as an example.

The restrictions for this project are light. Have fun with this!
-  **DO NOT use a website template**. The point of the assessment show us what __you__ can do.
-  You can use CSS and JS libraries such as jQuery and Bootstrap if you prefer, but they are not required.
-  You are not required to include JavaScript in your website. It will count towards the BONUS if you do (see Rubric below).

You are **required** to host your website GitHub.  
-  If you are unfamiliar with Git version control or the GitHub platform, please follow these [painfully detailed instructions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Q5OhMybXsA-Rq4e3RpwoOrsDO1qjwJ4EQXT1DJDe3wY/edit?usp=sharing).

# Rubric
### Hosting
Websites should be properly hosted on GitHub.
### Content
Ideal websites will have content typically associated with a personal website such as the personâ€™s name, an 'About' section, accolades or projects, a contact section, etc. Anything additional, such as interactive components, will count towards the BONUS.
### Style
Although style can be subjective, ideal websites will have a clear intentional styling. A consistent color palette, font, and imagery should play a role in the overall look and 'feel' of the website. Anything additional, such as animations, will count towards the BONUS.
### Code
The HTML and CSS documents should be clear and organized. Any libraries used will not count towards this criteria. Anything additional, such as custom JavaScript, will count towards the BONUS.
### BONUS
Although not required, any additional effort or complexity will be taken into account in the BONUS section.
