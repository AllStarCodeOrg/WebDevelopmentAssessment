# Web Development Assessment - Create and host a website  
**Create a single page personal website from scratch (using HTML and CSS) and host it on GitHub.**

The content for this personal website does not have to be yours - you are free to use another person, a celebrity, a business, a pet (or anything fun, really!) as an example.

The restrictions for this project are light; have fun with this!
-  **Do NOT use a website template**. The whole point is to show us what __you__ can do.
-  You can use CSS and JS libraries (such as jQuery and Bootstrap) if you prefer, but they are not a requirement.
-  You are also not required to include JavaScript in your website, but if you do, it will count towards the BONUS (see Rubric below).

Since you are required to host your website on the GitHub platform...  
-  If you are familiar with Git and GitHub, feel free to jump down to the Rubric
-  If you are unfamiliar with Git version control and/or the GitHub platform, please follow these [painfully detailed instructions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Xl76xBSF6pvhqfRnKehN7oM3zpZ3uneNB3dHxeUGxAA/edit?usp=sharing).

# Rubric
### HOSTING
Websites should be properly hosted on GitHub.
### CONTENT
Ideal websites will have content typically associated with a personal website such as the personâ€™s name, an 'About' section, accolades or projects, a contact section, etc. Anything additional, such as interactive components, will count towards BONUS.
### STYLE
Although style can be subjective, ideal websites will have a clear intentional styling such as a consistent color palette, font, and imagery should play a role in the overall look and 'feel' of the website. Anything additional, such as animations, will count towards BONUS.
### CODE
The HTML and CSS documents should be clear and organized. Any libraries used will not count towards this criteria. Anything additional, such as custom JavaScript, will count towards BONUS.
### BONUS
Although not required, any additional effort or complexity will be taken into consideration.
